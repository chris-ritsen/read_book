This basically sets up a urxvt terminal window that runs vim inside of tmux
and automatically advances the cursor at a given rate.  It checks the length
of the word under the cursor sot that longer words cause more of a delay.
xrdb settings make a window with a huge font size and large line spacing, red
text on black and a default colored cursor.
